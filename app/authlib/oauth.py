OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0 is a protocol that allows a user to grant a third-party website or application access to the user's
protected resources, without necessarily revealing their long-term credentials or even their identity.

Agents:

* Resource owner (user), e.g. Petya
* Client (application), e.g. SuperApp
* Authorization server, e.g. Google
* Resource server (provider), e.g. Google Photos

Terms:

Identification - the process of identifying a user. It can be done by a name, email, id or phone number.

Authentication - the process of verifying the identity of a user. It can be done by a password, fingerprint, or
face recognition. OpenID Connect defines an ID token that is used to authenticate a user.

Authorization - the process of granting permissions to a user. It can be done by a scope, role, or permission.
OAuth 2.0 defines an access token that is used to authorize a user.
